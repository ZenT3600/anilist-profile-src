Have you ever felt like taking a break from fast-paced action and heart-breaking drama and just read something a little easier? Of course you did, everyone does at some point.

Sometimes it's good to just sit back and relax. Well, whenever you feel like doing that, I suggest giving _Ichizu Bitch-chan_ a try.

# Overview:
The manga starts off in a oneshot fashion, with chapter 1 (or 0, depending on who you ask) simply showcasing the concept that will be later expanded on.

The concept is as follows: A cute kouhai tries her hardest to seduce her senpai, but is ice cold to anyone else who tries to approach her. Yep, you heard me. Nothing special or extraordinary, just a simple school-life romance comedy.

The characters (even though there are some reoccuring ones every once in a while) are mainly two: Senpai-kun and his kouhai. These two remain un-named up until long into the series.

# Point:
It is true that the story does not seem especially interesting on paper and it is also true that the characters don't seem all that exciting either. Hell, even the drawings, while being very good, are not extraordinary or anything and, well, that's because that isn't the point of this manga. The point is __not__ to tell a breath-taking story, but to make the reader relax and smile. The simple story allows you to better appreciate the comedy and sheer cheerfulness that this manga offers and the simple characters let you more thoroughly enjoy the wholesomeness of the two of them.

Every chapter is fairly short, with the average chapter being about 4 pages long and the longer ones being around 8 or 9 pages. That makes this manga not only highly bingeable, but also fairly easy to pause. You'll probably never find yourself having to bookmark a page in the chapter you're reading. Whether it's because you're into it or just because you're almost at the end already, you'll always find yourself finishing the chapter before you even realize.

# Final Thoughts:
_Ichizu Bitch-chan_ is, despite the name, a really wholesome manga that'll keep you grinning from start to finish on every chapter. Wheter you're into action and taking a break from all the fight scenes or you just enjoy rom-comedies, this manga is most definetly worth a read and I higly recommend it.
