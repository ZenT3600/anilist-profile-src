When it comes to art, be it music, books or animanga, I've always found myself loving what's considered niche. Today I'm going to review a fairly unknown manga. A total of a stunning 60 people have completed it thus far, despite the manga being from 2016. Here goes...

# Description

The manga I'm talking about is _panpanya_'s _Doubutsutachi_, or simply _Animals_, if you prefer English titles to Romaji.

_Animals_, while never being clearly explained since the main character is just called _Shoujo_, is what looks like the autobiography of the author, telling her story as she grows up in her city and eventually moves out. The narration is somewhat linear yet episodic and is at times exaggerated and turned into something surreal, to keep it interesting.

Speaking of surreal, _panpanya_'s art-style also fits that description perfectly, from humans other than the main characters drawn either as bodies with giant heads with holes for mouths or as the raccoon-like animals you can see in the cover, to really basic and simple drawings placed on extremely beautiful and detailed backgrounds. I find this style to be really poetic and I think that each person who sees it will find a different hidden meaning of their own.

The chapters are mixed in length, spanning from 20 pages ones to as short as 2 or 3 pages, and are also divided by what seem like pages of _panpanya_'s diary, narrating her daily life, her discoveries of everyday yet interesting things and sometimes even full-page panels depicting _Shoujo_ throughout the city.

# Thoughts

While I was reading it, I found _Animals_ to be a very unique experience. The art-style, the storytelling, the overall mood, everything just clicked, making me want to read even more.

The diary pages that divide the various characters are a nice break from the story, which is calm, relaxed and somewhat strangely nostalgic, and, while at first I was skipping through them, I found myself going back to read them thoroughly, as they really add a lot to the manga, despite being completely unrelated to the story.

This manga -and honestly this author in general- are something I'd definitely recommend getting into, as the feeling that _panpanya_'s stories give you, and which I can only describe as nostalgic, is priceless. This manga is an overall 9 out of 10 for me and a must-read for anyone that finds enjoyment in reading poetic and thought-provoking manga.
