There's been a period of my manga-reading journey where I really enjoyed reading all sorts of oneshots, since they were able to portray all sorts of stories in such a short amount of pages. Out of all the oneshots that I read in that period, this one is definetly the best. Let me tell you about it.

# Description

The story I'm talking about is _Kariki Hajime_'s oneshot called _Liv_.

Just judging from the tags alone, you could definetely jump to conclusions and say that _Liv_ is a weird mix of genres; A romance manga about a zombie apocalypse is not something common, but please, hear me out.

_Aoki_ is a survivor in an apocalyptic world destroyed by a zombie apocalypse. One day, while asleep in an abandoned building, he hears the noise of dripping blood and wakes up to a zombie girl watching over him. Quickly, he grabs his weapon and is about to kill the zombie when, suddendly, it speaks: "Ao- ki".

I'm not going to spoil any more than that, since I'd be removing pages from a oneshot that's already short as it is, with only 55 pages to it.

Despite having to tell everythint it needs to in such a limited amount of pages, this oneshot does a great job with its story telling. That being said, the world building is a whole other story: the entire world is presented in aboht 2 pages which, even though the premise of a zombie apocalypse is very common, is way too short.

_Liv_ manages to be really dark in the themes it talks about, while also having its occasional cute and fluffy moments thanks to its reoccuring chibi panels.

# Thoughts

_Liv_ is definetely a great example of storytelling in my book: I really grew attached to the characters in the story, despite it being so short and the characters being so few, and ~!it managed to string me along all the way through, only to hit me at my most vulnerable!~.

Another great detail I found only after rereading the manga is ~!the way _Aoki_ refers to the zombie, startinf off calling her "it" to then start calling her "she" after traveling together!~

The art is well-made, both in the panels themselves and in the gorgeous cover at the front, and also reminds me of [Tsuiraku JK to Haijin Kyoushi](https://anilist.co/manga/99737)'s art, another great manga with breath-taking panels and art.

_Liv_ is definetely a great proof of concept of what I hoped to be a full-sized series. Overall, it deserves a fair 8 out of 10 from me.

# Afterword

Heya, sup, welcome, hey there, it's ya boy, Zen, the based manga reviewer, back at it with another review.

First of all, sorry for all the spoiler tags I put, but the last thing I wanted to do was spoil this oneshot, since I really enjoyed reading it.

That being said, I do hope you enjoyed this review as much as I enjoyed this manga, and I look forward to more people reading _Liv_.

That's all for now, cya! o7
