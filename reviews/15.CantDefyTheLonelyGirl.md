If any of you reading this take a glance at my posts from time to time, you'll know that I've recently came back to my *yuri arc*, stronger than ever before. The manga I want to review today was actually the first manga I layed my hands on after coming back to yuri. Let's dive in...

# Description

*Lonely Girl ni Sakaraenai*, or more commonly known as *Can't Defy the Lonely Girl*, is, as you might have guessed, a yuri manga. It follows the steps of *Ayaka Sakurai*, a model student with exam anxiety and a soft spot for baby chicks, and *Sora Honda*, a loner girl with a soft spot for, well... Ayaka. The two of them meet after *Ayaka* is tasked by her teacher to convince *Sora* to come back to school. *Sora* accepts surprisingly fast, but that's only because she wants to make a deal: She wants to be able to make one request to *Ayaka* every day.

The art-style is very much like a shoujo manga, cute and somewhat cold at times, especially in how the characters are drawn. It also makes great use of *chibis* to ease up the story with smile-inducing panels.

Both the characters of *Ayaka* and *Sora* are well established, with *Ayaka* being serious and clumsy and *Sora* being needy and straight-forward. The most well-thought-out characters of this manga, though, are the side-characters, which are interesting, yet somewhat flawed, making them feel real.

There are 32 chapters, each one of them around 20 to 30 pages long, making for a fairly long read despite the short amount of chapters. The author, *Kashikaze*, also put out lots of extra chapters, mostly *omakes*, which bring the total chapter count to 52.

# Thoughts

I want to start by saying that the *chibi* panels in this manga are divine. It might just be me having a soft spot for *chibis*, but they are some of my favourite panels ever, no doubt about it, and are definitely one of the main reasons I'm making this review.

When it comes to characters, and as I've mentioned before, I fell in love with most side-characters. Don't get me wrong, both the main-characters are great, but there's just something about the other that makes them special.

The *story-arcs*, if you'll let me user the term, never felt drawn-out or too short, but were actually really well spaced out, both in themselves and between one another, making for a seamless transition between each one.

If I had to give this manga a fair rating, I would give it no less than 8 out of 10, as I feel like that's well deserved.

# Afterword

Heyo, sup, it's me, Zen, I'm still the same guy as before (I think). Anyway, It's been a while since the last review, so... Hey! o/

I plan on getting back into making reviews a bit more frequently, as I had forgotten just how fun writing them was.

So yeah, that's all for now, cya o7
