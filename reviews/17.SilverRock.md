It's been a long while since I've read a manga that actually shook me to my core. Let me tell you about the experience that was this harmless-looking oneshot.

# Description

**Silver Rock** is the latest oneshot written by *Kan Mikami*, an artist mainly focused on this kind of media.

The story is told like so: *Fukumoto Taketumi* is a former jazz drummer now retired. His grand-daughter, *Anju*, picked up Taketumi's interests during her early childhood and planned to study music in college. That's the past, though. In the present, Anju decided to not go to a music college. Once she tells Taketumi, he decides to perform one last time, not even fully sure why himself.

That's as far as I'm willing to tell in a review. This is a 60 page oneshot afterall, meaning I can't go too far into thw story without ending up in spoiler territory. Don't be discouraged by the page count, though, as the story here is phenomenal and evocative.

The drawing style is great, especially when drawing spreads. It's raw while not sacrificing detail or cleanliness, which makes for some incredible panels.

# Thoughts

Let me state this at the beginning. I absolutely adore this manga. I would've never guessed while starting it that it would rank as high as it does in my list.

I immediatly fell in love for the artstyle, but soon after couldn't close out of it for the story. Don't get me wrong, this is not an action packed thriller with a big twist at the end or anything like that, it's actually kind of slow, and yet its mood, the atmosphere around it, it really sucks you in.

That being said, the artstyle that dragged me into this manga is not any lesser than its story. More than once I thought that I should make a wallpaper out of the panel I was reading, and I definitely will make one from the very last spread panel (if you've read it, you know what I'm talking about).

This manga is a journey. It looks so simple and really IS simple, and yet it really makes you feel a faint yet lasting emotion that I could only describe as peace.

I cannot, in full consciousness, give this manga any less thanfull marks. I wholeheartedly recommend it.
