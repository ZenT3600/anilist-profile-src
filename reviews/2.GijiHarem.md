Picture this: you're scrolling AniList and you come across the _Trending Manga_ section. You glance at it and this one manga catches your attention. You start reading it and fall in love with it. Yep, you just pictured my first time reading _Giji Harem_. Let me tell you about it!

# Description:

_Giji Harem_, also known as _Pseudo Harem_, tells the cute story of Rin, an actress in the Drama Club, trying her hardest to win over the heart of Eiji, the senpai she likes. In order to do that, she acts as various different manga stereotypes, to tease him while making it seem like he is in some sort of harem (hence the name of the series). As time passes, and also thanks to Rin's acting, the two of them grow closer and closer to eachother.

The chapters in this manga are usually about 4 pages long, though we do get some longer chapters for more important sections of the story, but that's to be expected, since this series started off as a _Twitter Manga_.

As for the characters, there's really not that many. Other than Eiji and Rin, the only other characters usually just appear for a few chapters and the leave, keeping the main focus on the wholesomeness of these two.

The art choice is kind of unusual for a romcom manga, as it leans more towards a comedy-manga's style rather than a romcom-manga's one. Even then, it looks great, so I have no complains on the matter.

# Thoughts:

Let me start this off by saying that I __absolutely love__ this type of manga, so I may get a little too excited when talking about it.

When first reading this, the absolute first thought that came to mind is that it really reminded me of [Ichizu Bitch-chan](https://anilist.co/manga/119121). The concept, the style, the characters and so on. I'm guessing they are pretty common parts of a Twitter Manga, but I personally find them really enjoyable.

One thing that I noticed while reading this manga is that the reactions of the characters seem way more realistic than any other reactions I've seen in romcom mangas. It makes me feel like I'm looking at two actual people rather than just characters, which amazes me.

Overall, this was a great read, and it absolutely deserved a spot in my _Favourite Manga_ section. The story is nice, the art looks good and the characters are great. I wouldn't give it any less than a solid 8 out of 10. I completely recommend it.

# Afterword

Ayo, it's me, Zen, the author of this review, sup. I just wanted to say that I think I'm getting kinda better at this (at least compared to my last review, which, now that I read it again, absolutely sucked).

If you enjoyed reading this, and maybe I convinced you to read this manga then please, do send me a message about it, I'd love to hear about it. 

~~Also I'm definetly not writing this because I've got to get to 2.2k characters, b- baka.~~
