// ------ TAGLINE: The wholesome and realistic story of a couple and their everyday life together ------

"What do __you__ look for when choosing a new manga to read?" 

Depending on who you ask this question to, the answer will be different. After all, everyone has their own favourite genre that they hold dear. One thing that is common to everyone, though, is _burnout_. Everyone, sooner or later, gets tired of reading the same stuff over and over.

Whenever you hit _burnout_, it's a good idea to slow down on the _Action_ and _Drama_ and look for something a little easier on you, something that relaxes you while still keeping you interested. This review is exactly about that type of manga.

# Description:

_Futari Ashita mo Sorenari ni_ is about the story of _Rio_ and _Yuuya_, two young adults living together, and their everyday life as a couple.

This is a fairly simple premise, but it's really well executed. Both the development of the story and the characters' actions feel genuine, which, together with the slow and calm pace of this manga, make for a very relaxing read.

A really good selling point of this manga, at least for me, is its art style. It feels really clean while also being expressive, which makes for some beautiful panels.

Another very good thing about this manga is the way  _Suzuyuki_, the author, dealt with its characters. The story doesn't only talk about  _Yuuya_ and _Rio_, but also their friends and family and the relationships they form. This makes the story give off a very realistic vibe.

As for the chapters, they are pretty short: about 9 or 10 pages each, making it easy to get involved in the story really fast and lose track of time.

# Thoughts:

Personally, I loved this manga. It was cute and wholesome while also being genuine and realistic. Not only that but it was also really funny and had me laugh quite a few times.

The main story was great, but at the same time I would also get really involved in all the supporting characters' stories. They didn't just feel like side characters, they felt like actual people with interesting personalities that made me feel attached to them.

There was no unnecessary drama and the story was relaxing all the way through the end. I never felt like I was forcing myself to keep reading, not even a little bit, which is honestly great.

Overall, reading this manga was a great choice. The story is cute, the art is fitting and the characters are captivating. If this isn't an 8.5 out of 10, then I don't know what is.
