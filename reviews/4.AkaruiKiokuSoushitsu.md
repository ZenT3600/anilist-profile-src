What if I told you there was a manga which took a topic that could've otherwise been dark and depressing and made an extremely wholesome romcom story out of it? I'm asking you because the manga I'm about to review fits this description perfectly.

# Description:

_Cheerful Amnesia_ follows the story of _Arisa_, a girl who lost all memories of the past 3 years of her life because of amnesia, and her girlfriend _Mari_. Despite her amnesia, _Arisa_ falls in love with _Mari_ once again as soon as they meet. The story from here on out is all about this unusual couple re-learning all about each other and their life together.

Even though this could've been the premise for a really gloomy manga, _Cheerful Amnesia_, as the title suggests, is cute and wholesome, both in its story and characters.

Speaking of characters, despite there being very few reoccurring ones, they all work really well in this setting. They're not necessarily realistic, but they all help the manga give off an even sweeter vibe than it would without them.

The manga is structured in a _4-koma_ fashion, meaning its chapters are made up of 4-panels strips. Even with this constraining structure, this is not an episodic manga. The chapters are all tied together, that way the main goal of the story doesn't get forgotten.

The art style is bright and expressive and, while it's not really an art style worth of a masterpiece, it does work in a good way with this story.

# Thoughts:

I personally really enjoyed this manga. Not only was it cute and sweet, but it was also short and refreshing, which I think is a very important thing for this kind of manga.

This is not really a realistic manga, but that's because it's not supposed to be one. _Cheerful Amnesia_ is supposed to be a relaxing and enjoyable romcom, and, if you ask me, it excels at that. More than a few times I found myself grinning at the way the manga treats otherwise lewd topics in such a wholesome way.

Overall, I really wish I could forget about the last couple of weeks of my life and read this manga once again. It was a very good read, and it would give it nothing less than an 8 out of 10.

# Afterword:

Heyo, sup, yo, hi, wassup, what's good, it's me, Zen, your local neighborhood reviewer who is about to run out of ways to say hello in his afterwords. This review took me a bunch of time to write compared to the other reviews of mine, but I'd say it turned out fairly decent. As I always say in my reviews, don't be shy and do let me know what you thought of this review by messaging me either here on AL or on my Discord. I'll reply as soon as I can.

That's all for now, see you next time~

~~Also yes, if you couldn't already tell, the part about me wanting to forget the last two weeks of my life is a joke, duh~~
