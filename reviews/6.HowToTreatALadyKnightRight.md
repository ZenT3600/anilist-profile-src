// ------ TAGLINE: A funny romcom between a tomboy knight lady and an abs-loving sorcerer ------

I'm not really sure whether or not to start this review by talking about abs fetishes. My mind tells me "yes", but the fear of God (a.k.a. the mods) tells me "no". Anyway, enough of that, this is already good enough of an introduction. Let me tell you my thoughts on this manga.

# Description

_How to Treat a Lady Knight Right_ is a romcom set in a fantasy world. Here lives the female MC of this story, _Leo Cornelia_. As you might have guessed from the title already, she is a lady knight, known as the strongest in the land. She was never treated as a woman, until she meets _Fooly Dent_, a sorcerer with an incredible love for abs and _Leo_. He professes his love to her, and the story begins.

Well, that's about it for the premise. Let's dive a little deeper. Let us talk about characters. _Leo_ is definetly a romcom FMC done right. She's not just your usual archetype and she actually has multiple aspects to her personality, such as both a cute and a strong side, not to mention a good dose of background history, which is not always a given. _Fooly_ on the other hand, isn't exactly the best of characters. While he does a good job at keeping the story going with his over-the-top personality and extreme love for abs, he doesn't have a whole lot of background history, which would have been a really good addition.

Moving on to the artstyle, I must say I really like how _Kengo Matsumoto_, the author of this manga, draws his characters, at least in this series. _Kengo_ managed to draw a _Leo_ that looks scary, strong and cute at the same time, and that's not an overstatement. The character design is definetly one of the biggest selling points of this manga.

Looking at the chapters, they are quite short, usually around 6 or 7 pages each, not to mention they are mostly episodic, so you can read a bunch of chapters, forget about the manga and then start it again without much repercussion. That is, if you ask me, a must for these types of romcoms, as it allows you to enjoy the story to the fullest without it getting hard to keep up.

# Thoughts

This manga was definetly a good read that I would recommend to both romcom and fantasy fans.

The story is both funny and cute and it made me chuckle quite a few times. I'm also quite a sucker for episodic romcoms, so there's that.

Finishing this review off, I must say that this is probably one of the very few manga series I'll ever consider re-reading. This series has definetly deserved a solid 8 out of 10 from me.
