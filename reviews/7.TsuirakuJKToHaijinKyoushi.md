This review isn't the usual review of mine, or, at least, not completely. While this manga is indeed a romcom, despite it's dark aspects and cynical storytelling, it's really not just **any** romcom. Hear me out.

# Description

_Tsuiraku JK to Haijin Kyoushi_, which, for simplicity purposes, I'll from now on call _JK to Haijin_, easily takes the crown for most unexpected premise in a romcom. _Mikoto Ochiai_, the female lead of this story, is about to jump off the school building because of a broken heart, when, all of a sudden, _Jin Haiba_, the male lead and her teacher, stops her by talking to her and asks her to go out with him.

This is about it for the premise. Going further in the manga, the storytelling stays just as cynical, while managing to keep the air not too tense, but just tense enough. As you can imagine, this manga thrives on dark humor, and it's also really good at it.

As of writing this review, _JK to Haijin_ is yet to be finished, which means we still lack the full backstory of the characters, but, from what I've read so far, thw characters are masterfully written. That includes both their backstories and their interactions with one another, which feel more realistic than the usual manga.

The chapters are fairly long, hitting an average of about 30 pages each. Trust me, though, when I tell you that you will not get bored of them, because the drawings in each panel are, despite being really rough and sketchy, extremely poetic in their own way.

# Thoughts

What attracted me to _JK to Haijin_ at first was its cover art, which is, in my opinion, incredible. The artist in charge of drawing this manga did a marvelous job at it. What made me stay was the story's progression, as well as the drawings on the pages themselves, which are, in my opinion, a beautiful mix between simple and touching. The drawings are easily my favourite part of the whole manga.

I personally like dark humor a lot, so the jokes in each chapter never failed to make me chuckle and smile, while still keeping me focused on the story itself instead of distracting me from it, which could've been a huge drawback in terms of storytelling.

All things considered, I feel like this manga is something I would recommend to both romcom fans and psychological fans. It, in my opinion, deserves nothing less than an 8.5 out of 10.

# Afterword

Hello hello, it's me, Zen. This time I tried challenging myself with a different review than usual, or rather, a different manga than usual, since the review style is mostly the same. I hope you enjoyed this review, and would love to hear what other people think about this manga.

Also, I would like to digress by saying that I still have to reach 2.2k characters, which, if you ask me, is pretty weirdchamp, so I'm adding this sentece in here. Sowwy.

Anyhow, that's everything I have for this time, cya! o/
