Recently, after reading manga and only manga for a fairly long time, I've started my Manhua Arc. Today I want to tell you about the first Manhua I've stumbled upon, and why **you** should also give it a try.

# Description

*Wo Jia Laopo Lai Zi Yiqian Nian Qian*, or, for simplicity purposes, *My Wife Is From a Thousand Years Ago* is about a female warrior from the chinese Tang Dynasty, *Jiang He*, who suddendly finds herself in modern times. Alone and clueless on how to navigate this new world she's in, Jiang He finds her way to *Xu Quing*'s apartment, where, after figuring out her true identity, he takes her in to teach her about today's world.

That's the premise for this manhua. A fairly unique one too, as usually it's the modern day person that gets transported into another world, not the other way around.

The drawing style for this manhua is really good too, with really well detailed, large shots of characters in poetic scenes and chibi, cute drawings of facial expressions in comedic scenes. Overall, the style the artist went for is on point and really well executed.

The chapters are fairly long, averaging around 15 pages. What's better is, the manhua being in webtoon format, you won't even notice the pages changing. You'll just keep on scrolling, getting more and more invested in this cute, yet at times deep, story.

When I say deep it's not just random, I really mean it. The author makes you think about *Jiang He*'s perspective a lot. She losr everyone she knew and loved in an instant and is now in a world she knows nothing about. This way of seeing the story really makes you feel for her, and helps you get more invested in it.

# Thoughts

Personally, I find this manhua really enjoyable. It's not a masterpiece or anything, but I still get a big ol' smile on my face when a new chapter comes out. The best way I could describe it is exactly *Really Enjoyable*.

Other than that, I also found the genre choice interesting. It's a, if you'll allow me the term, *Reverse Isekai*, a genre I had never explored before.

All in all, this manhua is really good in my book, and I'd give it a solid 8.5 out of 10.

# Afterword

Heya, it's me, Zen, the dude that always adds afterwords. No, I don't do it to make the review longer (not entirely, at least), I do it 'cause I think it's a nice way of ending a review.

Anyway, this is all I have for today. It's a different format of story, but the usual genres I know and love. I hope you liked this review!

Until next time, o7
