I've fairly recently come across a yuri manga I've found myself to really enjoy, only to figure out on volume 5 that no new chapters are coming out anytime soon. While I wait for the new volume to come out, let me tell you about the story thus far. Who knows, maybe you'll too get invested in the story.

# Description

The manga I'm talking about is called _Whisper Me a Love Song_ and is both written and illustrated by _Eku Takeshima_.

Starting off from the story, I would say that it reminds me the most of a mix between [K-ON!](https://anilist.co/anime/5680)'s setting and locations and [Bloom Into You](https://anilist.co/manga/86218)'s story and feeling. Let me explain. _Whisper Me a Love Song_ is about a first year kouhai, _Himari Kino_ who falls in love with her senpai, _Yori Asanagi_ after seeing her perform with her band on the first day of school. After confessing to her senpai, _Himari_ slowly starts to realize that her meaning of "love" is different from _Yori_'s meaning of it. She starts asking herself what it really means to "love" someone, and the story starts to unfold.

As of now, this may just seem like it takes a lot of inspiration from Bloom Into You, and that's because it does, but trust me, it's far from being a rip-off. The feeling this manga gives, at times cheery, at times deep, is different from the one given by Bloom Into You, plus the K-ON!-ish setting gives the series its own little spin on this otherwise really interesting yet not unique theme.

The drawings are extremely cute, and that's not exaggerating. _Eku Takeshima_ chose a very fitting artstyle for this series, one that allowed them to make the reader blush, while still allowing the more observant reader to realize there's hidden meaning beneath most conversations.

I can't comment on the length of the series just yet, as it's not finished, but what I can say is that the chapters are fairly long, averagin at about 40 pages each. Most of them also start with a few full-color pages, which is always nice to see.

# Thoughts

When I first picked up this manga it was because of the cutesy cover and wholesome title, but I soon realized that I actually enjoyed the series itself. I found myself thinking back at it multiple times during my everyday life and smiling by myself.

As thw manga progressed, I found it more and more interesting. The story itself is really catchy and refreshing, while also keeping you on edge in the more important scenes.

One part that I particularly liked as of writing this is the first time _Himari_ and _Yori_ meet on the roof of the school building. I found that scene somehow soothing.

This series is definetly a good read for all yuri fans in my book. If you ever find some time on your hands, do give it a try, as I'd give it nothing less than an 8.5 out of 10.
